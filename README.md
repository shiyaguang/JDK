JDK
===

Source code from JDK's src.zip. Can be used for study the evolution of Java.

# How it works

I [download](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) different versions of JDK from 1.1.x to the recent released 7u25, install or unzip them, commit source code of every src.zip into a different branch in the repository.

* For JDK 1.2.2_005 and earlier, I download package for Windows. (There's no package for Linux)
* For JDK 1.2.2_006 and latter, I download package for Linux. (For no needs to install, just unzip)

# License

Since all the code come from JDK, they belong to Sun or Oracle, you can find the license information in each file.
